# ACCEPTANCE_FREEZES.md

**Purpose:** Append-only ledger of accepted user-facing or operator-facing milestones.

Use this when a screen, route, workflow, or other visible milestone is accepted
and must be protected from quiet regression.

## Entry Format

```yaml
- ID: AF-YYYY-MM-DD-001
  Milestone: short milestone name
  Scope: what was accepted
  repo_path: /absolute/path/to/repo
  branch: main
  head: abc1234
  process_or_container: npm dev | docker container name | other
  port_or_base_url: http://localhost:3000
  routes:
    - /
    - /settings
  rebuilt_in_slice: true
  duplicate_runtimes_checked: true
  evidence_refs:
    - EV-YYYY-MM-DD-001
  regression_guard:
    - later work must branch from this accepted lineage
    - route-role changes require explicit backlog scope and new evidence
  Notes: optional
```

## Guidance

- Do not treat screenshots alone as an acceptance freeze.
- Tie the accepted state to repo truth, runtime truth, and evidence truth.
- If a later report conflicts with the freeze, prove runtime identity before drawing conclusions from git history.
